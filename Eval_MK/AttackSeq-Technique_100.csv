The malware also runs CreateProcess with commands to manipulate file ownership and drops batch files to delete the initial malware file and winword.exe.","Initial Access: On April 30, 2019, the ThreatRecon Team reported that SectorB06, a state-sponsored threat actor group, has been exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, specifically a highly obfuscated version of CVE-2017-11882. The group targeted organizations by using a Mongolian language decoy document referencing the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs of Mongolia. The document was uploaded from a Singapore IP address and was designed to drop first-stage malware if the exploit was successful.
Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by decompressing and dropping two files: RasTls.dll (renamed from cclerr.wll) and IntelGraphicsController.exe/AcroRd32.exe, which is a legitimate signed Symantec file (real name: dot1xtra.exe). These files are stored in directories related to Intel Processor Graphics and are added to the registry run keys for persistence. The registry key used is 'IntelGraphicsController' with a specific value format.
Defense Evasion: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including checking for debuggers, process name hashing, and process injection. It also uses timestomping to modify the timestamps of its dropped files to approximate those of kernel32.dll. Additionally, the malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable file to avoid detection.
Discovery: The malware performs discovery by querying the registry and identifying victim machines using a specific registry key under 'Software\Intel\Java'. It also checks for the presence of certain processes on the system.
Command and Control: The second-stage malware, which was not analyzed in detail, is designed to create a remote command shell and communicates with external C2 IP addresses on port 443. It also references internal IP addresses, indicating that the threat actor already has basic access to the victim's internal network.

The Poison Ivy builder allows output as either a PE file or shellcode. In this case, the backdoor was built as shellcode and then obfuscated to prevent detection. The encoded shellcode is decoded with a single byte addition of 0x99, XOR with 0xD4, then subtract 0x33. The decoded shellcode is launched by ssMUIDLL.dll.","Initial Access: Unit 42 observed a new variant of Poison Ivy, named SPIVY, being deployed via weaponized documents leveraging CVE-2015-2545. The documents were themed around recent Hong Kong pro-democracy events. The exploit drops a self-extracting RAR containing three files: a legitimate executable (RasTls.exe) for side-loading the malware DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), and an encoded shellcode Poison Ivy backdoor (samsung.hlp).
Defense Evasion: SPIVY uses a modified network communication protocol to help evade detection. Unlike previous versions of Poison Ivy which utilize a fixed 256 byte challenge-response handshake, SPIVY generates a payload with 1 to 16 bytes of pseudo-random data plus control bytes, where the 1st byte indicates the length of the padding before the handshake. The remainder of the protocol remains unchanged.
Command and Control: Two C2 domains were identified: sent.leeh0m[.]org and found.leeh0m[.]org, both third-level domains off of leeh0m[.]org, created in late February 2016. Unit 42 observed two configurations with SHA256 hashes 9c6dc1c2ea5b2370b58b0ac11fde8287cd49aee3e089dbdf589cc8d51c1f7a9e and 4d38d4ee5b625e09b61a253a52eb29fcf9c506ee9329b3a90a0b3911e59174f2, both using password 'bqesid#@', C2 port 443, and mutex '40EM76iR9'.
Others: The decoy documents associated with SPIVY reference specific events and organizations related to the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. One decoy is from Joshua Wong, announcing a press conference about ending the Scholarism group to start a political party, Demosistō. Another concerns the Mong Kok riot, purporting to be from the Justice & Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese.

This is so far a relatively more advanced and covert method of network communication among APT hacker attacks. Onion City means that the deep web searching engine uses Tor2web agent technology to visit the anonymous Tor network deeply without using the Onion Brower specifically. And OnionDog uses the Onion City to hide the Trojan-controlling server in the Tor network. In recent years, APT attacks on infrastructure facilities and large-scale enterprises have frequently emerged. Some that attack an industrial control system, such as Stuxnet, Black Energy and so on, can have devastating results. Some attacks are for the purpose of stealing information, such as the Lazarus hacker organization jointly revealed by Kaspersky, AlienVault lab and Novetta, and OnionDog which was recently exposed by the 360 Helios team. These secret cybercrimes can cause similarly serious losses as well. In view of OnionDog's pattern of activity, we are likely to observe a new round of attacks this summer. The relevant threat intelligence and technical analysis report will be updated by 360's Intelligence Center(https://ti.360.com).",T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer,onion-dog-a-3-year-old-apt,"T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, T1102.003-One-Way Communication, T1599-Network Boundary Bridging, T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription"

It employs a DLL loader to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload, typically a first-stage backdoor. This backdoor can receive and load additional executables from external attackers. The infection begins with a malicious DLL loader, which can be triggered by modifying a legitimate server application to import the malicious DLL or through phantom DLL hijacking and DLL side-loading. The loader searches for a hardcoded path to decrypt the payload, which is then injected into an existing Windows Service, such as LanmanServer, run by svchost.exe.","Defense Evasion: In a recent campaign, Waterbear was observed using API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific security product. The malware injects code into the security product to hide its network behaviors. The payload uses API hooking to modify the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, thus avoiding detection while the original system DLL files remain unchanged. The API hooking is designed to hide specific processes and TCP endpoint records associated with Waterbear's activities.
Command and Control: Waterbear's first-stage backdoor configuration contains information required for execution and communication with external entities. It includes an encryption/decryption key, version, mutex, and XOR-encrypted C&C server address. If the backdoor is intended to listen on a specific port, this section will be filled with 0x00. The backdoor can connect to a C&C server or open a port to wait for external connections and load incoming executables.
Others: The Waterbear campaign targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia, specifically Taiwan, and sometimes Japan and Hong Kong. The attackers demonstrate knowledge of the victims' environments and security products, indicating a high level of familiarity with their targets. The API hooking shellcode is generic and could potentially be used to target other security products in the future, making Waterbear harder to detect.",T1129-Shared Modules,"Waterbear is Back, Uses API Hooking to Evade Security Product Detection","T1129-Shared Modules, T1569.002-Service Execution, T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1586.003-Cloud Accounts"

This enabled the deployment of malware, including the PowerLess Backdoor.
Persistence: The PowerLess Backdoor creates persistence through scheduled tasks. The malware loader 'WindowsProcesses.exe' uses the Registry RunKeys or Startup Folder for boot or logon autostart execution. Additionally, the malware uses server software components like web shells for persistence.
Defense Evasion: The Phosphorus group's PowerLess Backdoor evades detection by running PowerShell within a .NET application, not spawning 'powershell.exe'. The group also impairs defenses by disabling or modifying system firewalls and modifies the registry to aid in defense evasion.
Credential Access: The PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger module that captures user input, effectively accessing credentials. Additionally, OS credential dumping is performed using known LOLBIN techniques, such as leveraging 'Comsvcs.dll'.
Discovery: The Phosphorus group's PowerLess Backdoor has the capability to perform account discovery, specifically targeting local accounts on compromised systems.
Lateral Movement: After exploiting the Microsoft Exchange Server, the attackers used the PowerLess Backdoor to run reconnaissance commands and create persistence. They then dumped credentials and attempted to move laterally within the network.
Collection: The PowerLess Backdoor is capable of archiving collected data, including stealing browser data and keylogging information. The data is stored in paths such as 'C:\Windows\Temp\Report.06E17A5A-7325-4325-8E5D-E172EBA7FC5BK' and 'C:\Windows\Temp\cup.tmp'.
Command and Control: The PowerLess Backdoor communicates with a command and control (C2) server using web protocols and encrypted channels that employ symmetric cryptography. The backdoor also uses proxy techniques for C2 communication.
Others: The Phosphorus group, also known as APT35 or Charming Kitten, has been active in cyber espionage and offensive cyber attacks, operating in the interest of the Iranian regime.

In May 2012, this domain resolved to the same IP as another domain used in Android malware attacks targeting the Tibetan community.","Initial Access: The Citizen Lab analyzed a malicious email sent to Tibetan organizations in June 2013, which appeared to be from a prominent member of the Tibetan community and contained repurposed content from a community mailing list. The email had three attachments that seemed to be Microsoft Word documents (.doc) but were actually trojaned with a malware family named 'Surtr'. All three attachments dropped the same malware, which has been used in attacks on Tibetan groups since November 2012.
Execution: The 'Surtr' malware creates a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process using the CreateRemoteThread function.
Persistence: For persistence, 'Surtr' adds a key to the registry to ensure it runs when the infected computer is restarted. It also stores its command and control (C2) information and a campaign code in the registry. Depending on the configuration, 'Surtr' will either create multiple registry keys in Software\Microsoft\Windows Media in HKU (hkey users) with text data or a single key called XC consisting of binary data, usually xor encrypted with a key of 0x1.
Defense Evasion: The 'Surtr' malware uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Word (CVE-2012-0158) to execute malicious code. Despite the vulnerability being known since April 2012 and a patch released by Microsoft, the malware was initially detected by only three antivirus engines, highlighting the need for up-to-date systems and applications. The malware also attempts to evade antivirus heuristics by padding the resource section with varying amounts of 00 bytes, resulting in a much larger file size (30-50mb).
Discovery: 'Surtr' has capabilities including listing file directories and contents on the victim computer and any USB drives connected, viewing web cache, executing remote commands, and logging keystrokes. It creates folders to store temporary information such as file and directory listings and keylogger output, which is disguised by adding a constant to the ordinal value of the character.
Others: The Citizen Lab's research into 'Surtr' malware targeting the Tibetan community reveals that the malware monitors mailing lists and discussion groups to repurpose content for targeted attacks. The malware can download additional components, such as 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0', which can provide attackers with further abilities like accessing the victim computer's webcam or microphone.
