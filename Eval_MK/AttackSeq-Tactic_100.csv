The group targeted organizations by using a Mongolian language decoy document referencing the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs of Mongolia. The document was uploaded from a Singapore IP address and was designed to drop first-stage malware if the exploit was successful.","Execution: The first-stage malware, identified as RasTls.dll, begins by resolving encoded API addresses and then starts a thread to poll for the presence of a debugger, exiting if one is found. It uses a custom hashing algorithm to check the process name it is running under against a list of expected names, including 'winword.exe', 'excel.exe', 'powerpnt.exe', 'acrord32.exe', and 'eqnedt32.exe'. The malware also runs CreateProcess with commands to manipulate file ownership and drops batch files to delete the initial malware file and winword.exe.
Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by decompressing and dropping two files: RasTls.dll (renamed from cclerr.wll) and IntelGraphicsController.exe/AcroRd32.exe, which is a legitimate signed Symantec file (real name: dot1xtra.exe). These files are stored in directories related to Intel Processor Graphics and are added to the registry run keys for persistence. The registry key used is 'IntelGraphicsController' with a specific value format.
Defense Evasion: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including checking for debuggers, process name hashing, and process injection. It also uses timestomping to modify the timestamps of its dropped files to approximate those of kernel32.dll. Additionally, the malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable file to avoid detection.
Discovery: The malware performs discovery by querying the registry and identifying victim machines using a specific registry key under 'Software\Intel\Java'. It also checks for the presence of certain processes on the system.
Command and Control: The second-stage malware, which was not analyzed in detail, is designed to create a remote command shell and communicates with external C2 IP addresses on port 443. It also references internal IP addresses, indicating that the threat actor already has basic access to the victim's internal network.

In mid-2020, UNC1945 deployed the EVILSUN tool containing a zero-day exploit for CVE-2020-14871 on a Solaris 9 server, facilitating remote exploitation without authentication.","Execution: UNC1945 utilized custom virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools to execute commands, transfer files, and establish tunnel connections. They also employed a custom Linux backdoor named LEMONSTICK for command execution and file transfer.
Persistence: UNC1945 established persistence on a Solaris 9 server using the SLAPSTICK backdoor, which allowed user access with a secret hard-coded password. They also placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder to maintain access.
Privilege Escalation: UNC1945 escalated privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and open source tools like Mimikatz. They also installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO on various endpoints after escalating privileges.
Defense Evasion: UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques using a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH to clean logs and built-in Linux commands to alter timestamps. They also executed a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI in memory to obfuscate activity.
Credential Access: UNC1945 collected credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz, enabling lateral movement throughout networks and access to other network segments and third-party environments.
Discovery: UNC1945 maintained various tools for internal reconnaissance, including network scanners, exploits, and reconnaissance tools contained within their custom virtual machines.

Persistence: In the 2014 campaign, the malware dropped two files on the targeted system: a decoy document and a fake svchost.exe binary, both stored in ""C:\Windows"". In the 2016 campaign, the malware was dropped in the local setting of the current user and a shortcut was created to launch winnit.exe in the startup folder. In the 2017 campaigns, persistence was achieved by a Windows shortcut named adobe distillist.lnk.
Defense Evasion: The malware has evolved over time, moving from a single file to a dual file structure (an executable and a dynamic library), and the decoy documents have become more advanced. The malware checks if a file used on a previous version of KONNI is available on the system.
Credential Access: The malware is capable of stealing keystrokes and credentials from browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.
Collection: The malware is designed to steal files, keystrokes, and perform screenshots.
Exfiltration: The malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

33,104,104-Reconnaissance,Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros?,Defense Evasion,Reconnaissance,Lateral Movement,Initial Access,"Reconnaissance: The Carbon Black ThreatSight team observed a campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. These emails were designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware upon successful execution. The campaign utilized various techniques favored by red teamers, espionage-focused adversaries, and large-scale criminal campaigns.","Initial Access: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros. The document, named 'Richard_Johnson.doc', was one of approximately 180 variants identified by Carbon Black, with differences primarily in metadata and junk data within the macros. The document's metadata indicated that the campaign's documents were first saved on December 17, 2018, and continued to be updated until January 21, 2019.
Execution: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script would then download and execute payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
Defense Evasion: The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads. The script would first attempt to use the DownloadString method to contact the C2 server and then the DownloadData method to download a resource from a second C2 server.
Impact: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. GandCrab, a variant of version 5.0.4, would encrypt files on the compromised system, while Ursnif would perform actions such as credential harvesting, gathering system and process information, and potentially deploying additional malware.
Others: The campaign was analyzed using VirusTotal Graph, which organized the variants into groups commonly associated by metadata or document structures.

Notable ransomware families include Netwalker, REvil, Maze, DoppelPaymer, and RansomEXX. Attackers often steal data before encrypting the victim's copy and demand ransoms for decryption and non-disclosure. Manufacturing and industry, as well as healthcare, were particularly targeted. In healthcare, Ryuk ransomware attacked Universal Health Services, disrupting patient care. REvil attacked Valley Health hospitals, stealing and publishing patient medical data. SunCrypt ransomware attacked University Hospital New Jersey, stealing and publishing patient records.","Initial Access: The Emotet trojan, which resurfaced in July, is spread via phishing emails and has downloader functionality, enabling it to deliver other malware. Emotet initially spread Trickbot spyware, which after collecting information opened up access to Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Later, attackers installed the QakBot (QBot) banking trojan on victim computers. Emotet sends more than 500,000 emails daily on weekdays, excluding weekends, and uses message threads on the infected computer for spreading.
Defense Evasion: Attackers are getting creative about hiding their tracks to maintain stealth, even against sandboxes. One incident involved a special malicious plugin (PhysXPluginMfx) for Autodesk 3ds Max, which remained inactive if Task Manager or Process Monitor was running. Zeppelin ransomware returned with a new downloader that evades dynamic analysis in a sandbox by stopping malicious activity for 26 seconds after the downloader performs its work.
Others: The number of cyberattacks grew by 2.7% in Q3 2020 compared to Q2, and by 54% compared to Q3 2019. Ransomware is increasingly prevalent, with 51% of malware attacks using ransomware in Q3. Manufacturing and industrial companies, as well as healthcare institutions, are primary targets. The percentage of social engineering attacks using COVID-19 as a lure fell from 16% in Q2 to 4% in Q3. Hacking as an attack method on companies grew by 12 percentage points to 30%, likely due to the pandemic and the transition to working from home. Vulnerabilities in services on the perimeter of corporate systems are being actively exploited. To protect from cyberattacks, it is recommended to follow guidelines for personal and corporate cybersecurity, including a well-organized vulnerability management process, security solutions like WAF, traffic analysis, SIEM systems, and verifying email attachments in a sandbox.",Impact,Cybersecurity_threatscape-2020-Q3.ENG,"Impact, Defense Evasion, Command and Control, Privilege Escalation"

Additionally, the attackers used BITSAdmin to transfer malware to the victims' systems, as indicated by the command line used for the operation.","Initial Access: The ScarCruft group, also known as APT 37, Group123, Ricochet Chollima, and Venus121, targeted journalists, North Korean defectors, and government officials. They employed phishing emails with links to download Office documents containing decoy content. Upon clicking the link and downloading the document, the host system would be compromised, and an Office Macro Script would be loaded to facilitate further malicious activities.
Execution: The execution phase involved the use of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware onto the compromised host systems. Additionally, PowerShell and Golang malware were used alongside BITSAdmin for DLL Side-Loading to execute malicious scripts and establish command and control.
Defense Evasion: The ScarCruft group utilized DLL Side-Loading techniques for defense evasion. They loaded the Chinotto malware using evc.dll and employed mfc42u.dll as a loader to execute the malware without detection.
Collection: The group collected information from compromised hosts and exfiltrated data to their command and control servers. The compromised host analysis revealed the use of UltraVNC.ini and Ultra VNC Server for information collection, indicating the presence of mobile infostealer malware and command and control capabilities developed in Golang (ably).
Command and Control: ScarCruft established command and control channels using HTTP requests to specific PHP scripts on their C2 servers. They also used Golang malware to communicate with the attacker's channel, sending commands and receiving command results through an Ably key and Client Hello messages.
Others: The report includes the concept of 'Defend Forward,' developed by the US Department of Defense to proactively disrupt or stop malicious cyber activities at an early stage and increase the cost to adversaries. This approach involves an aggressive defensive mindset, identifying victims, incident response, and takedown of distribution sites. The incident response process includes malware analysis, investigation, C2 monitoring, threat tracking, identification of additional victims, blocking command and control and download sites, and developing countermeasures to prevent recurrence.",Exfiltration,ScarCruft (APT37) active in South Korea,"Exfiltration, Command and Control, Impact, Collection"

In the classic APT case of the Stuxnet virus, which broke into an Iranian nuclear power plant, the virus used an employee's USB disk to circumvent network isolation. OnionDog also used this channel and generated USB worms to infiltrate the target internal network.
Command and Control: When the OnionDog Trojan is successfully released, it will communicate to a C&C (Trojan server), download other malware and save them in the %temp% folder and use ""XXX_YYY.jpg"" uniformly as the file name. These names have their special meaning and usually point to the target.

The self-set lifecycle of a Trojan attack is 15 days on average and is distinctly organizational and objective-oriented. OnionDog concentrated its efforts on infrastructure industries in Korean-language countries. In 2015 this organization mainly attacked harbors, VTS, subways, public transportation and other transportation systems. In 2014 it attacked many electric power and water resources corporations as well as other energy enterprises. 360's Threat Intelligence Center has found 96 groups of malicious code, 14 C&C domain names and IP related to OnionDog. It first surfaced in October 2013, and then was most active in the summers of the following years. The Trojan set its own ""active state"" time and the shortest was be three days and maximum twenty nine days, from compilation to the end of activity. The average life cycle is 15 days, which makes it more difficult for the victim enterprises to notice and take actions than those active for longer period of time. In 2014, OnionDog used many fixed IPs in South Korea as its C&C sites. Of course, this does not mean that the attacker is located in South Korea. These IPs could be used as puppets and jumping boards. By 2015, OnionDog website communications were upgraded to Onion City across the board.

It employs a DLL loader to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload, typically a first-stage backdoor. This backdoor can receive and load additional executables from external attackers. The infection begins with a malicious DLL loader, which can be triggered by modifying a legitimate server application to import the malicious DLL or through phantom DLL hijacking and DLL side-loading. The loader searches for a hardcoded path to decrypt the payload, which is then injected into an existing Windows Service, such as LanmanServer, run by svchost.exe.","Defense Evasion: In a recent campaign, Waterbear was observed using API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific security product. The malware injects code into the security product to hide its network behaviors. The payload uses API hooking to modify the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, thus avoiding detection while the original system DLL files remain unchanged. The API hooking is designed to hide specific processes and TCP endpoint records associated with Waterbear's activities.
Command and Control: Waterbear's first-stage backdoor configuration contains information required for execution and communication with external entities. It includes an encryption/decryption key, version, mutex, and XOR-encrypted C&C server address. If the backdoor is intended to listen on a specific port, this section will be filled with 0x00. The backdoor can connect to a C&C server or open a port to wait for external connections and load incoming executables.
Others: The Waterbear campaign targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia, specifically Taiwan, and sometimes Japan and Hong Kong. The attackers demonstrate knowledge of the victims' environments and security products, indicating a high level of familiarity with their targets.
