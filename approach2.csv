The most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred during this scenario is **ATT&CK 2013**, which detects additions via methods like ""AddItem"" or ""AddPath"". The use of `UseRegisterItem` through `CreateProcess` adds files to the registry, triggering these detection methods. Additionally, manual deletion of traces could involve removing data that might be part of a cleanup process, though this isn't a specific technique. Therefore, ATT&CK 2013 is the likely method used.

The ATT&CK technique most likely used before the files modified their timestamps to prevent detection by others who exploit Windows systems using Office's Equation Editor are **Timestomp** (WindowsIR Anti-Forensic Techniques) and **Masquerading**. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Timestomp**:  
   - Timestomp is a technique where the timestamp (modify, access, create, or change time) of a file is modified to avoid detection by forensic tools.
   - It was used before adding timestomping because it allowed attackers to hide additional attacks that others might exploit.

2. **Masquerading**:  
   - Masquerading is another Timestamp technique where the timestamp information is hidden or obfuscated. This makes it harder for other systems (like Windows) to detect an attack before it can proceed.

By using both Timestomp and Masquerading, attackers could hide their actual activity while still allowing others who use Windows systems to exploit them once they have modified the timestamps.",36.5505
